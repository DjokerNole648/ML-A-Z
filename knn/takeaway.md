## Take-away for KNN
### To get started with KNN
#### from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
### Important parameters for KNN
#### number of neighbors(k): default value is 5
#### Minkowski Distance: When p = 1 we have the Manhattan distance(absolute distance), When p = 2 we have the Euclidean distance(square root distance)
